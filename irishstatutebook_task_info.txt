Each parsed section is stored to a PDF file and a paired PDF.metadata.json file.
The PDF file should be named as ‘sXXcXXpXX_legislation.PDF', e.g. s38c1p1_tca1997 which represents section 38 chapter 1 part 1 for TCA1997;
 or 'schedXX_legislation.PDF’ for the schedules in legislation e.g. sched1_tca1997.

Note that there may be parts/sections under the individual schedule, but ignore them and save everything in the same
 schedule into one single file.

The matched PDF.metadata.json should have the same name as PDF file, i.e. 'sXXcXXpXX_legislation.PDF.metadata.json'.
The elements in the json file should look like below:
{ "legislation": string, //e.g. "TCA 1997",
 "part index": string, //e.g. "Part 3",
 "part title": string, //e.g. "Provisions Relating to the Schedule C Charge and Government and Other Public Securities",
 "chapter index": string, //e.g. "Chapter 1",
 "chapter title": string, //e.g. "Principal provisions relating to the Schedule C charge",
 "section index": string // e.g. "Section 38",
 "schedule index": string //e.g. "Schedule 1". When it’s the schedule, you should leave all 'part index', 'part title', 'chapter index', 'chapter title', 'section index' as empty.
 "section title": string // e.g. "Supplementary Provisions Concerning the Extension of Charge to Tax to Profits and Income Derived From Activities Carried on and Employments Exercised on the Continental Shelf",
 "summary": string // leave this as empty. }

After you finish TCA 1997; then do the same for the following four other legislations in the same way.
VAT 2010: https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/act/31/enacted/en/html
Stamp duty 1999: https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1999/act/31/enacted/en/html
CAT 2003: https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/1/enacted/en/html
Company Act 2014: https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/38/enacted/en/html
